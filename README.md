# sport_radar

This is a set of functions to scrape and manipulate Sport Radar data obtained with their API. THESE CAN ONLY BE USED IF YOU HAVE AN API KEY WHICH IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE REPO.

For any of the functions to work, you need to have a file named "R/key_dont_push.R" whose contents are

`key = "XXX"`

where "XXX" is your API key.
